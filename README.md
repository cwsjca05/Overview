# Overview
An overview of the work I have done with independently learning programming

Currently I have put up repositories for the projects I completed in order to earn a JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Developer Certification.  I had been working on the lessons for a while and finished up the last project on 12/27/2018.  The certification can be viewed here:

I had also been doing the lessons in the responsive web development curriculum from FCC and worked through the projects there, earning a Responsive Web Design Developer Certification on 12/26/2018.  Although the two were completed in two days, I spent a lot longer going over the lessons and projects; I just happened to finish the final project in each a day apart.  This certification can be viewed here:

I plan to get the static sites I built as part of the latter certification hosted on GitHub Pages soon.
